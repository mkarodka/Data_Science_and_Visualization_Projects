## Business Questions Answered in the Dashboard

The dashboard in this project answers several key business questions:

1. **How do sales vary by day of the week and hour of the day?**
   - **Dashboard Answer**: The dashboard includes time-based pivot tables and charts that display sales data broken down by both day of the week and specific hours, highlighting patterns in customer purchasing behavior.

2. **Are there any peak times for sales activity?**
   - **Dashboard Answer**: A line graph or heatmap in the dashboard showcases sales peaks during different times of the day and on specific days of the week, making it easy to identify rush hours and high-demand periods.

3. **What is the total sales revenue for each month?**
   - **Dashboard Answer**: The dashboard presents monthly sales trends through a line chart or bar graph, summarizing total revenue for each month to visualize sales performance over time.

4. **How do sales vary across different store locations?**
   - **Dashboard Answer**: A location-based pivot table, combined with a bar chart, shows the variation in sales across different store branches, allowing a comparison of performance across all locations.

5. **What is the average price/order per person?**
   - **Dashboard Answer**: The pivot tables and calculated fields within the dashboard provide the average order value per person, offering insights into customer spending patterns.

6. **Which products are the bestselling in terms of quantity and revenue?**
   - **Dashboard Answer**: A bar chart and pivot table display the best-selling products, both by quantity sold and by total revenue, giving a clear view of the top-performing items.

7. **How do sales vary by product category and type?**
   - **Dashboard Answer**: A pie chart or segmented bar graph visualizes sales distribution across different product categories and types, helping identify which categories contribute the most to overall sales.
